## Quick start

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r api/requirements.txt -r ingest/requirements.txt pytest

docker start pg
docker exec pg psql -U postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE capstone;"
docker exec -i pg psql -U postgres -d capstone < sql/schema.sql
docker exec -i pg psql -U postgres -d capstone < sql/seed.sql

./scripts/verify.sh          # you will score 0/27. That is the starting line.
```

Everything runs locally. No AWS account, no credit card, no spend.
